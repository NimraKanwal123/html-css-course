        <!-- **Why Use Semantic Tags? -->
        <!-- **They enhance SEO, improve accessibility, and make your code easier to read and maintain. -->
         <!--** These tags does not style you webpage like aside tag will not aside your content you will aside it by using css -->
    <!-- 
     <header>: The header tag defines content that should be considered the introductory information 
         of a page or section.
     <nav>: The navigation tag is used for navigation links. It can be nested within the <header> tag,
         but secondary navigation <nav> tags are also commonly used elsewhere on the page.
     <main>: This tag contains the main content (also called the body) of a page. There should 
         be only one tag per page.
     <article>: When to Use: Use <article> when you have content that can be read and understood independently. 
     <section>: Using <section> is a way of grouping nearby content of a similar theme.
         A section tag differs from an article tag. It isn’t necessarily self-contained, but it forms part of something else. 
         Independence: <article> is for content that can stand alone, while <section> is for grouping related content within a document.
         Context: <article> elements are often nested within <section> elements to provide context and structure to the document
     <aside>: An aside element defines content that’s less important. 
         It’s often used for sidebars—areas that add complementary but nonessential information.
     <figure>: this tag specifies self-contained content, like illustrations, diagrams, photos, code listings, etc.
         The <figcaption> tag defines a caption for a <figure> element.
     <footer>: You use <footer> at the bottom of a page. It usually includes contact information,
         copyright information, and some site navigation.
      <times>: this tag is used to represent time related information like date and times.
